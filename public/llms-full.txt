## Identity

Riad di Siena is an 18th-century guesthouse in Marrakech medina, two minutes from Jemaa el-Fna, scored 9.0 on Booking.com across 584 verified guest reviews. It operates as an owner-run maison d'hôtes — a living heritage house restored with attention to preserving three centuries of Moroccan architectural craft. The property has 6 rooms across two houses: three at the main riad (37 Derb Fhal Zefriti) and three at The Douaria, a restored annex steps away in the same derb.

The property is distinguished by personal hospitality: a staff score of 9.56, a house manager (Zahra) mentioned by name in over 80 reviews, and a handmade Moroccan breakfast praised by 62% of all reviewers. The architecture retains its original zellige, gebs, and zouak — a rare thing in a city where many riads have been gutted and rebuilt with factory tilework.

## Architectural Heritage

The building follows the classic Moroccan dar typology: rooms arranged around a central open-air courtyard (wust al-dar), with a fountain as the focal point. In Islamic architectural tradition, the exterior is deliberately plain — beauty is reserved for the interior. This is not a design choice; it is a philosophical position about privacy, sanctuary, and the relationship between public and private life.

### Craft Traditions Preserved in the Building

**Zellige** — Geometric mosaic tilework. Each piece is hand-cut from a larger glazed ceramic tile using a traditional hammer (menqash). The geometric patterns are mathematically precise, based on Islamic geometric principles that explore infinity through repetition. The craft dates to at least the 10th century in Morocco, with major centers in Fes and Meknes. The zellige in Riad di Siena is original to the building, not a modern reproduction.

**Gebs** — Hand-carved ornamental plaster. Wet plaster is applied to walls and carved while still damp using fine chisels. The designs typically feature arabesques (flowing vegetal forms), muqarnas (honeycomb vaulting), and calligraphic elements. Unlike European stucco, Moroccan gebs is carved by hand rather than cast from molds, making each surface unique.

**Zouak** — Polychrome painted and carved cedarwood. Used on ceilings, door frames, and window screens. The cedar (from the Atlas Mountains) is carved with geometric and floral patterns, then painted in traditional colors: deep red, green, gold, and blue. Cedar was chosen historically for its natural insect resistance and aromatic properties.

**Tadelakt** — Burnished lime plaster with a distinctive waterproof sheen. A technique originating in Marrakech, used in hammams, fountains, and wet rooms. The plaster is polished with flat river stones and treated with olive oil soap (savon noir) to create a surface that is both waterproof and luminous. The word comes from the Amazigh (Berber) verb "dlak" meaning to rub or knead.

**Bejmat** — Traditional terracotta floor tiles, typically rectangular, laid in herringbone or chevron patterns. Fired in wood kilns at lower temperatures than modern tiles, giving them a characteristic warmth and irregularity.

### Architectural Typology

The dar typology evolved as a response to climate, culture, and Islamic principles of privacy:
- **Climate**: Thick earthen walls (60-80cm) provide thermal mass, keeping interiors cool in summer (when Marrakech exceeds 40°C) and warm in winter. The open courtyard creates natural ventilation through the stack effect.
- **Privacy**: The inward-facing design eliminates street-facing windows. The mashrabiya (carved wooden screen) allows light and air while preventing views from outside.
- **Water**: The central fountain is not decorative; it cools the air through evaporation and references the Islamic garden tradition of paradise (janna) with four rivers.

## Location

Address: 37 Derb Fhal Zefriti, Laksour, Marrakech 40000, Morocco
GPS coordinates: 31.6295°N, 7.9811°W
Neighborhood: Laksour, Marrakech medina (2 min walk from Jemaa el-Fna) (UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed 1985)

### Nearby Heritage (Walking Distance)

The riad is in Laksour, a quiet residential neighborhood within the medina, two minutes from Jemaa el-Fna. The following heritage sites are all within walking distance:

The Kasbah is one of the oldest residential quarters in the medina, historically associated with the Saadian dynasty (1549-1659) and the Royal Palace (Dar el-Makhzen). The word "kasbah" means fortified citadel in Arabic and Amazigh. Unlike the commercial quarters of the medina (souks, fondouks), the Kasbah has maintained its residential character.

Key heritage sites in the nearby Kasbah quarter:

**Saadian Tombs** — Royal necropolis of the Saadian dynasty, built by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur (r. 1578-1603). Rediscovered in 1917 after being sealed for centuries by the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail. Notable for Italian Carrara marble columns, muqarnas plasterwork, and zellige tilework. The Hall of Twelve Columns contains the tombs of the Saadian princes.

**Bab Agnaou** — One of the 19 original gates of Marrakech and the only stone-built gate (most are rammed earth/pisé). Built in the 12th century under the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur. Decorated with Kufic calligraphy and a palmette frieze. The name may derive from Amazigh "agnaw" meaning "deaf" or "mute" (impenetrable).

**El Badi Palace** — Ruins of the great Saadian palace built by Ahmad al-Mansur in 1578 to celebrate the Battle of the Three Kings. Originally decorated with Carrara marble, onyx, and gold. Stripped of its decorations by Moulay Ismail in the late 17th century. The sunken gardens and massive walls remain.

**Royal Palace (Dar el-Makhzen)** — The official residence of the King of Morocco when in Marrakech. The compound covers approximately 17 hectares. Not open to the public.

**Mellah** — The historic Jewish quarter, adjacent to the Kasbah. Established in 1558 under Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib. Home to the Lazama Synagogue (still active) and the Miâara Jewish Cemetery. Morocco's Jewish community dates back over 2,000 years, predating Islam in North Africa.

## Beyond the Walls — Extended Properties

### The Douaria (Marrakech Medina)
A separate restored house in the same derb, steps from the main riad. Additional rooms with more space and independence. "Douaria" refers to a small traditional house used as an extension of a larger property — a common pattern in medina real estate where wealthy families expanded by acquiring neighboring houses.

### The Kasbah (Draa Valley)
A traditional fortified house in southern Morocco's Draa Valley, between the High Atlas and the Sahara. The kasbah typology — thick rammed-earth walls (pisé), corner towers, flat roof — evolved as both defense and climate adaptation in the arid pre-Saharan zone. The Draa Valley contains one of the highest concentrations of kasbahs and ksour (fortified villages) in Morocco.

### The Desert Camp (Erg Chebbi, Merzouga)
A tented camp at the base of the Erg Chebbi sand dunes — the largest erg (sand sea) in Morocco, with dunes reaching 150 meters. Standard and premium tent options with en-suite facilities. Activities include camel trekking and Saharan dinners. The geology of Erg Chebbi dates to the Quaternary period; the orange-red color comes from iron oxide in the sand grains.

### The Farm (Atlas Foothills)
An agricultural property supplying the riad with seasonal produce, olive oil, herbs, and eggs. Located in the foothills of the High Atlas, approximately 45 minutes from Marrakech. Traditional Moroccan farming practices: gravity-fed irrigation (seguia system), olive terraces, seasonal crop rotation.

## Cultural Journeys

Multi-day cultural journeys through Morocco's architectural and natural landscape are operated through Slow Morocco (https://www.slowmorocco.com). The signature journey is the 3-Day Sahara Circle: Marrakech → Tizi n'Tichka Pass (High Atlas, 2,260m) → Draa Valley (The Kasbah) → Erg Chebbi (The Desert Camp) → Marrakech.

These are not tour packages. They are curated cultural immersions — small groups, meals included, with emphasis on the craft traditions, geology, and human geography of each region. The journeys connect the architectural heritage of Marrakech's medina with the earthen architecture of the south, the geological formations of the Sahara, and the agrarian traditions of the Atlas.

## Climate

Marrakech has a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh). The riad's thick earthen walls and courtyard design provide natural temperature regulation:
- **Summer** (June-August): Often exceeds 40°C. The courtyard cools the interior through evaporation and shade.
- **Winter** (December-February): Mild days (18-22°C), cold nights (5-8°C). All rooms have heating.
- **Spring/Autumn**: The most comfortable seasons, 25-35°C. Clear skies, lower humidity.
