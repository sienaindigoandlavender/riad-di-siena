# Riad di Siena

> An 18th-century house in Marrakech medina, scored 9.0 by 584 guests on Booking.com. Known for personal hospitality, handmade daily breakfast, and preserved zellige, gebs, and zouak craftsmanship.

## About

Riad di Siena is a restored 18th-century traditional Moroccan dar in Marrakech medina, two minutes from Jemaa el-Fna. The property preserves three centuries of Moroccan architectural craft — hand-cut zellige tilework, carved stucco (gebs), painted cedar ceilings (zouak), and polished lime plaster (tadelakt) — in a living house, not a museum. Six rooms across two houses: three at the main riad around a central courtyard with a zellige fountain, three at The Douaria annex steps away. Rooftop terrace with Atlas Mountain views. Daily Moroccan breakfast prepared fresh by the household. Staff score: 9.69. Guests mention the house manager Zahra by name more than any other detail.

Riad di Siena is owner-operated and independent. It is classified as a maison d'hôtes (guesthouse) under Moroccan tourism law.

## Architectural Heritage

The building follows the classic Moroccan dar typology: rooms facing inward around a central open-air courtyard (wust al-dar). In Islamic architectural tradition, beauty is reserved for the interior — the exterior is deliberately unadorned.

Preserved original features:
- Zellige: geometric mosaic tilework, each piece hand-cut from glazed ceramic — a craft tradition dating to 10th-century Morocco
- Gebs: hand-carved ornamental plaster on walls and archways
- Zouak: polychrome painted and carved cedar wood on ceilings and door frames
- Tadelakt: burnished lime plaster with a waterproof sheen, a technique originating in Marrakech
- Bejmat: traditional terracotta floor tiles
- Courtyard fountain: central water feature following the Islamic garden tradition of the four rivers
